Counteracting cellular oxidative stress via the inhibition of glutathione reductase (GR) has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy. Houttuynia cordata, a medicinal plant known for its potent antioxidant properties, has been the focus of our investigation. In this study, we conducted comprehensive in silico analyses involving the phytochemical constituents of H. cordata to identify potential natural GR inhibitors. Our methodological approach encompassed multiple in silico techniques, including molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, MMPBSA analysis, and dynamic cross-correlation analysis. Out of 13 docked phytochemicals, Quercetin, Quercitrin, and Sesamin emerged as particularly noteworthy due to their exceptional binding affinities for GR. Notably, our investigation demonstrated that Quercetin and Sesamin exhibited promising outcomes compared to the well-established pharmaceutical agent N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Molecular dynamics analyses provided insights into the ability of these phytochemicals to induce structural compaction and stabilization of the GR protein, as evidenced by changes in radius of gyration and solvent-accessible surface area. Moreover, MMPBSA analysis highlighted the crucial roles of specific residues, namely Gly27, Gly28, Ser51, His52, and Val61, in mediating essential interactions with these phytochemicals. Furthermore, an assessment of Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity (ADME-Tox) profiles underscored the favourable drug-like attributes of these phytochemicals. Thus, the current findings underscore the immense potential of Houttuynia cordata phytochemicals as potent antioxidants with the capacity to combat a spectrum of maladies, including malaria and cancer.

This study presents an innovative approach to drug development by integrating machine learning (ML) techniques to identify the potential BACE1 inhibitors. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset of protein-ligand interactions, the current study employed a machine learning model to generate novel ligands with high binding affinity and specificity for the BACE1 active site. The model’s efficacy was validated through molecular docking studies, which demonstrated superior binding affinities compared to existing FDA-approved inhibitors such as Atabecestat and Lanabecestat. The findings reveal that the top candidate, MLC10, exhibits a unique mechanism of action by promoting controlled flexibility in BACE1, contrasting with the rigid conformations induced by traditional inhibitors. This dynamic modulation enhances the enzyme’s inhibition, suggesting a promising avenue for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, solvent-accessible surface area analyses indicate that MLC10 facilitates a more favourable protein conformation, potentially altering catalytic behaviour through increased solvent interactions. This work underscores the transformative potential of machine learning in drug discovery, paving the way for the development of next-generation BACE1 inhibitors.

Herein, we have investigated the molecular interaction of Pexidartinib, a novel, primitive and highly selective therapeutical agent against CSF-1R overexpression, with human serum albumin (HSA) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) using various spectroscopic methods, docking and simulations. The intrinsic fluorescence of the proteins considerably quenched on PEX addition accompanied by a slight blue shift. The complex formation between PEX and BSA/HSA induced some alterations in the molecular milieu of the tryptophan residues. The active binding locus was found to be within the hydrophobic cavity of Sudlow site I of both BSA and HSA.

The bulge interacts with the TAT protein vital for transactivating viral RNA, while the loop interacts with cyclin-T1, contingent on TAT binding. Through extensive atomistic and free energy simulations, we investigate TAR–TAT binding in nonpathogenic bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV) and pathogenic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Thermodynamic analysis reveals enthalpically driven binding in BIV and entropically favored binding in HIV. The broader global basin in HIV is attributed to binding-induced loop fluctuation, corroborated by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), indicating classical entropic allostery onset. While this loop fluctuation affects the TAT binding affinity, it generates a binding-competent conformation that aids subsequent effector (cyclin-T1) binding. This study underscores how two structurally similar apo-RNA scaffolds adopt distinct conformational selection mechanisms to drive enthalpic and entropic allostery, influencing protein affinity in the signaling cascade."},{title:"Exploring the interaction of a potent anti-cancer drug Selumetinib with bovine serum albumin: Spectral and computational attributes",authors:"Jalan A, Sangeet S, Pradhan AK, Moyon S",journal:"Journal of Molecular Recognition",doi:"10.1002/jmr.3084",year:2024,abstract:"The binding of drugs to plasma proteins determines its fate within the physiological system, hence profound understanding of its interaction within the bloodstream is important to understand its pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics and thereby its therapeutic potential. In this regard, our work delineates the mechanism of interaction of Selumetinib (SEL), a potent anti-cancer drug showing excellent effect against multiple solid tumors, with plasma protein bovine serum albumin (BSA), using methods such as absorption, steady-state fluorescence, time-resolved, fluorescence resonance energy transfer, Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR), circular dichroism (CD), synchronous and 3D-fluorescence, salt fluorescence, molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulations. The BSA fluorescence intensity was quenched with increasing concentration of SEL which indicates interactions of SEL with BSA. Stern–Volmer quenching analysis and lifetime studies indicate the involvement of dynamic quenching. However, some contributions from the static quenching mechanism could not be ruled out unambiguously. The association constant was found to be 5.34 \xd7 105 M−1 and it has a single binding site. The F\xf6rster distance (r) indicated probable energy transmission between the BSA and SEL. The positive entropy changes and enthalpy change indicate that the main interacting forces are hydrophobic forces, also evidenced by the results of molecular modeling studies. Conformation change in protein framework was revealed from FTIR, synchronous and 3D fluorescence and CD studies. Competitive binding experiments as well as docking studies suggest that SEL attaches itself to site I (subdomain IIA) of BSA where warfarin binds. Molecular dynamic simulations indicate the stability of the SEL–BSA complex. The association energy between BSA and SEL is affected in the presence of different metals differently."},{title:"In silico Screening of Potential Phytochemicals Against Extracellular Adherence (EAP) Protein of Staphylococcus aureus from Indian Medicinal Plants",authors:"Zeenat L, Prajapati S, Sangeet S, Khan A, Pandey KM",journal:"Research Journal of Pharmacy and Technology",doi:"10.52711/0974-360X.2023.00762",year:2023,abstract:"Background: Staphylococcus aureus is a threat to human health, it colonizes one-third of the human population via skin or nose and deeper intrusions into tissues have catastrophic consequences. The bacterium secretes virulence proteins like CHIP and SCIN and extracellular adhesins like extracellular adherence (Eap) proteins. Eap and its functionally orphan homologs, EapH1 and EapH2; are a class of secreted proteins that inhibit neutrophil serine proteases such as neutrophil elastase (HNE) that is linked to tissue degradation in a variety of disease conditions including inflammatory disorders. Commercial drugs used against S.aureus such as Nafcillin, Pefloxacin, etc. have been known to have negative effects and are not recommended for children, the elderly, or pregnant women. Objective: The current research focuses on discovering phytochemicals found in Indian medicinal herbs that have been used as spices for ages and are already beneficial against a variety of illnesses and ailments to be used against Eap proteins. Method: Molecular docking;absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicity (ADMET) analysis and Simulation were performed to see if these phytochemicals interact with the active site residues of Eap proteins and function as competitive inhibitors of NE and to know their drug like properties and gather information about the system dynamics. 19 phytochemicals were selected from receptor-ligand docking. The selected molecules were pharmacologically tested through Lipinski’s analysis; to know their ability for being formulated into drugs.

Spike protein and ACE2 have become significant spaces of study and pulled in a more extensive examination given their function as potential obnoxious elements for the spread of the infection. The highly conserved nature of RBD in SARS-CoV-2 makes it a potential target site for antiviral drugs to inhibit its interaction with the ACE2. The current study focuses on the in silico examinations of phytochemicals from medicinal plants in order to screen out a potent drug candidate against the RBD domain. Molecular docking studies exhibited the potential of top phytochemicals that actively and closely interacted with the key residues of the RBD. Further investigation using Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF) and Pharmacological & Pharma toxicological studies revealed the phytochemicals that can be used as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2. This study suggested the potential of screened phytochemicals to act as potent antiviral candidates against SARS-CoV-2.

The viral spike protein has undergone several modifications/mutations at the genomic level, through which it modulated its structure–function and passed through several variants of concern. Recent advances in high-resolution structure determination and multiscale imaging techniques, cost-effective next-generation sequencing, and development of new computational methods (including information theory, statistical methods, machine learning, and many other artificial intelligence-based techniques) have hugely contributed to the characterization of sequence, structure, function of spike proteins, and its different variants to understand viral pathogenesis, evolutions, and transmission. Laying on the foundation of the sequence–structure–function paradigm, this review summarizes not only the important findings on structure/function but also the structural dynamics of different spike components, highlighting the effects of mutations on them. As dynamic fluctuations of three-dimensional spike structure often provide important clues for functional modulation, quantifying time-dependent fluctuations of mutational events over spike structure and its genetic/amino acidic sequence helps identify alarming functional transitions having implications for enhanced fusogenicity and pathogenicity of the virus. Although these dynamic events are more difficult to capture than quantifying a static, average property, this review encompasses those challenging aspects of characterizing the evolutionary dynamics of spike sequence and structure and their implications for functions."},{title:"Computational analysis of Bacopa monnieri (L.)

Background: Neurotrophins play a crucial role in the development and regulation of neurons. Alterations in the functioning of these Neurotrophins lead to several Neurodegenerative Disorders. Albeit engineered medications are accessible for the treatment of Neurodegenerative Disorders, due to their numerous side effects, it becomes imperative to formulate and synthesize novel drug candidates. Objective: This study aims to investigate the potential of Bacopa monnieri phytochemicals as potent antineurodegenerative drugs by inspecting the interactions between Neurotrophins and target proteins. Methods: The current study employs molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation studies to examine the molecular interactions of phytochemicals with respective Neurotrophins. Further inspection of the screened phytochemicals was performed to analyze the ADME-Tox properties in order to classify the screened phytochemicals as potent drug candidates. Results: The phytochemicals of Bacopa monnieri were subjected to in-silico docking with the respective Neurotrophins. Vitamin E, Benzene propanoic acid, 3,5-bis (1,1- dimethylethyl)- 4hydroxy-, methyl ester (BPA), Stigmasterol, and Nonacosane showed an excellent binding affinity with their respective Neurotrophins (BDNF, NT3, NT4, NGF). Moreover, the molecular dynamic simulation studies revealed that BPA and Stigmasterol show a very stable interaction with NT3 and NT4, respectively, suggesting their potential role as a drug candidate. Nonacosane exhibited a fluctuating binding behavior with NGF which can be accounted for by its long linear structure. ADME-Tox studies further confirmed the potency of these phytochemicals as BPA violated no factors and Vitamin E, Stigmasterol and Nonacosane violated 1 factor for Lipinski’s rule. Moreover, their high human intestinal absorption and bioavailability score along with their classification as non-mutagen in the Ames test makes these compounds more reliable as potent antineurodegenerative drugs.

This process could lead to irregular data being generated along with a high risk of altered analysis. Thus, the current study lays out the foundation for a preprocess pipeline using data analysis to analyze the genomic data set for its accuracy. We have used the recent example of SARS-CoV-2 to demonstrate the process overflow that can be utilized for various kinds of biological exploration such as understanding mutational events, evolutionary divergence, and speciation. Our analysis reveals a significant amount of sequence divergence in the gamma variant as compared with the reference genome thereby making the variant less infective and deadly. Moreover, we found regions in the genomic sequence that is more prone to mutational localization thereby altering the structural integrity of the virus resulting in a more reliable molecular viral mechanism.

The current work focusses on the synthesis of the FeNPs from Piper betel leaf extract and clove bud (Syzygium aromaticum) extract as these are major post-lunch/dinner intakes and exhibit good medicinal properties. The SEM and XRD analyses reveal the crystalline form of synthesized FeNPs. Major phytochemicals involved in the synthesis of FeNPs were found out, and using computational approach, the three-dimensional structure of the phytochemical conjugated nanoparticles was prepared. To confirm the interactions between the synthesized iron nanoparticles and CHIP virulence protein of S. aureus, the computational docking analysis was done. The results revealed a significant bit of interaction between the nanoparticles and the virulence system of S. aureus. The current study can potentially open up new directions aimed at targeting the bacterial infection."},{title:"DRUG DISCOVERY AGAINST COVID-19 FROM INDIAN MEDICINAL PLANTS–COMPUTATIONAL APPROACH",authors:"Sangeet S, Khan A",journal:"International Journal of Engineering Applied Science and Technology",doi:"10.33564/IJEAST.2020.v05i06.047",year:2020,abstract:"Coronavirus pandemic has caused an enormousmisfortune for the worldwide economy just as worldwidewellbeing.
